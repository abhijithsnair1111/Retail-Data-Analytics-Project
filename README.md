# Retail Data Analytics: EDA + Advanced Analytics for a Retail Chain

Welcome to the Retail Data Analytics Project 🚀

This is a **Full Stack Data Analysis** Project for a Retail Chian. This project consists of **EDA** along with **Advance Analytics** to generate reports for creating **BI Dashboards**

This project is build upon fictional retail data generated by **LLMs** based on **Real Life Business Scenerios** and underwent a complete **ETL Process**

---

## Project Overview 🪛

Analyse and Create Reports for a retail chain to answer business questions and provide insights into future desicion making. This include in depth analysis and generating answers for all the existing business questions.

The Processes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the Database to understand all structure and basic details regarding the content
  
- **Advanced Analytics:** Use advance methods to form coplex calculations and generate insights for reports

---

## Data Architecture 📐

The Source data for this project is the Database **RetailDB** which has be constructed as part of the [Data Warehouse Project](placeholder).

The Architecture for this project consists of the main Database **RetailDB**. The main Schema inside the database named **Gold** is made up of one **Fact** table and two **Dimension** tables

- Fact Table  - Sales Details `gold.fact_sales`
  
- Dimension Table - Customer Details `gold.dim_customers`

- Dimension Table - Products Details `gold.dim_products`

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

[Data Catalog](docs/data_catalog.md) provides a detailed breakdown of the tables and columns inside the tables

To further simplify each table the various columns inside each table can be split into two main categories

- **Dimensional Value:** Charcter or Numerical value where aggregations are not possible
- **Measure Values:** Numeric value where aggregations are possible

Each tables should be examined to find important columns belonging to each category

## Analysis 📈

The first part of this project is **Data Analysis**. Exploring and Understanding the data to extract patterns, and futher manupulating it using advance methods form complex results  
Thus the entire process is split into two parts

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  
- **Advanced Analytics**

Each stage is further dived into six parts focusing on a specific action respective to the process

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The purpose of doing an initial EDA for this project is to develop an basic understanding about the structure and various relations that make up the tables.  

- **Database Exploration**
  - Purpose: Explore the structure of the Database. Understand the Tables and thier Schemas, explore all the Columns and its metadata
  - Script: [`database_exploration`](scripts/database_exploration.sql)
  - Insights: How the Schema, Tables and Columns inside the Database are structured

- **Dimensions Exploration**
  - Purpose: Explore the Dimensional values inside the tables. Understand the cardinality of such values for future categorization
  - Script: [`dimensions_exploration`](scripts/dimensions_exploration.sql)
  - Insights: All the unique Countries in which the customers belong to, All the different Categories, Subcategories and Products Names

- **Measures Explorations**
  - Purpose: Explore the Measure values inside the table. Understand the basic aggregations that can be performed on the measures
  - Script: [`measures_exploration`](scripts/measures_exploration.sql)
  - Insights: Generated a basic report regarding all the key metrics of the sales (Sales, Orders, Quantity, Price , Products and Customers)
 
- **Date Exploration**
  - Purpose: Explore the Date range of several important date values.
  - Script: [`date_exploration`](scripts/date_exploration.sql)
  - Insights: Extacted the first and last Order Date and the months in between them, Extracted the oldest and youngest customer
 
- **Magnitude Analysis**
  - Purpose: Understand data dstributions across categories. Group measures by dimensions
  - Script: [`magnitude_analysis `](scripts/magnitude_analysis.sql)
  - Insights: Extracted several aggregations by categoreis such as Total Customers by Countries/Gender, Total Produts by Categories
    
- **Ranking Analysis**
  - Purpose: To rank different dimensions according to various measures. Find out the top or bottom performers
  - Script: [`ranking_analysis`](scripts/ranking_analysis.sql)
  - Insights: Extracted Top and Bottom performing products and customers, products based on their performance, customers based on their purchase

### Advanced Analytics
The purpose of the Advanced Analytics is to understand the data in depth by forming complex calcultions to extract insight and generate comprehensive reports

- **Change Over Time Analysis**
  - Purpose: Track trends, growth and chages in key values over time. Understand performance of over time
  - Script: [`change_over_time_analysis`](scripts/change_over_time_analysis.sql)
  - Insights: Analysed Sales performance over time
 
- **Cumulative Analysis**
  - Purpose: Calculate Running Totals ans Moving Averages of key values. Performance over time cumulatively
  - Script: [`cumulative_analysis`](scripts/cumulative_analysis.sql)
  - Insights: Caculated Running Total Sales and Moving Average Prices
 
- **Performance Analysis**
  - Purpose: Calculate the Performace of a metrics by itself over time. Year Over Year analysis
  - Script: [`performance_analysis`](scripts/performance_analysis.sql)
  - Insights: Calculated each product performance compared to the average product sales and the previous year sales
 
- **Part To Whole Analysis**
  - Purpose: Calculate the proportion of a metric in a given category compared to the whole aggragated value
  - Script: [`part_to_whole_analysis`](scripts/part_to_whole_analysis.sql)
  - Insights: Calculated how much each category contributed to the overall sales
 
- **Data Segmentation Analysis**
  - Purpose: Group data into meaningful categories based on a specific metric
  - Script: [`data_segmentation_analysis`](scripts/data_segmentation_analysis.sql)
  - Insights: Segemented products into cost ranges and counted the number of products in each segment

- **Reports**
  - All the above analysis are summarized a single report for both the **Customers** and the **Products** to created a detailed report on all the important metrics and calculations
  - Script: [`customer_report`](scripts/customer_report.sql) and [`product_report`](scripts/product_report.sql)
