# Retail Data Analytics: EDA + Advanced Analytics for a Retail Chain

Welcome to the Retail Data Analytics Project 🚀

This is a **Full Stack Data Analysis** Project for a Retail Chian. This project consists of **EDA** along with **Advance Analytics** to generate reports for creating **BI Dashboards**

This project is build upon fictional retail data generated by **LLMs** based on **Real Life Business Scenerios** and underwent a complete **ETL Process**

---

## Project Overview 🪛

Analyse and Create Reports for a retail chain to answer business questions and provide insights into future desicion making. This include in depth analysis and generating answers for all the existing business questions.

The Processes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the Database to understand all structure and basic details regarding the content
  
- **Advanced Analytics:** Use advance methods to form coplex calculations and generate insights for reports

---

## Data Architecture 📐

The Source data for this project is the Database **RetailDB** which has be constructed as part of the [Data Warehouse Project](https://github.com/abhijithsnair1111/Retail-Data-Warehouse-Project.git).

The Architecture for this project consists of the main Database **RetailDB**. The main Schema inside the database named **Gold** is made up of one **Fact** table and two **Dimension** tables

- Fact Table  - Sales Details `gold.fact_sales`
  
- Dimension Table - Customer Details `gold.dim_customers`

- Dimension Table - Products Details `gold.dim_products`

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

[**Data Catalog**](docs/data_catalog.md) provides a detailed breakdown of the tables and columns inside the tables

---

## Analysis 📈

The first part of this project is **Data Analysis**. Exploring and Understanding the data to extract patterns, and futher manupulating it using advance methods form complex results  
Thus the entire process is split into two parts

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  
- **Advanced Analytics**

Each stage is further dived into six parts focusing on a specific action respective to the process

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The purpose of doing an initial EDA for this project is to develop an basic understanding about the structure and various relations that make up the tables.  

- **Database Exploration**
  - Purpose: Explore the structure of the Database. Understand the Tables and thier Schemas, explore all the Columns and its metadata
  - Script: [`database_exploration`](scripts/database_exploration.sql)
  - Insights: How the Schema, Tables and Columns inside the Database are structured

- **Dimensions Exploration**
  - Purpose: Explore the Dimensional values inside the tables. Understand the cardinality of such values for future categorization
  - Script: [`dimensions_exploration`](scripts/dimensions_exploration.sql)
  - Insights: All the unique Countries in which the customers belong to, All the different Categories, Subcategories and Products Names

- **Measures Explorations**
  - Purpose: Explore the Measure values inside the table. Understand the basic aggregations that can be performed on the measures
  - Script: [`measures_exploration`](scripts/measures_exploration.sql)
  - Insights: Generated a basic report regarding all the key metrics of the sales (Sales, Orders, Quantity, Price , Products and Customers)
 
- **Date Exploration**
  - Purpose: Explore the Date range of several important date values.
  - Script: [`date_exploration`](scripts/date_exploration.sql)
  - Insights: Extacted the first and last Order Date and the months in between them, Extracted the oldest and youngest customer
 
- **Magnitude Analysis**
  - Purpose: Understand data dstributions across categories. Group measures by dimensions
  - Script: [`magnitude_analysis `](scripts/magnitude_analysis.sql)
  - Insights: Extracted several aggregations by categoreis such as Total Customers by Countries/Gender, Total Produts by Categories
    
- **Ranking Analysis**
  - Purpose: To rank different dimensions according to various measures. Find out the top or bottom performers
  - Script: [`ranking_analysis`](scripts/ranking_analysis.sql)
  - Insights: Extracted Top and Bottom performing products and customers, products based on their performance, customers based on their purchase

### Advanced Analytics
The purpose of the Advanced Analytics is to understand the data in depth by forming complex calcultions to extract insight and generate comprehensive reports

- **Change Over Time Analysis**
  - Purpose: Track trends, growth and chages in key values over time. Understand performance of over time
  - Script: [`change_over_time_analysis`](scripts/change_over_time_analysis.sql)
  - Insights: Analysed Sales performance over time
 
- **Cumulative Analysis**
  - Purpose: Calculate Running Totals ans Moving Averages of key values. Performance over time cumulatively
  - Script: [`cumulative_analysis`](scripts/cumulative_analysis.sql)

## Business Questions & Insights 🔎
This project started as a means to answers business question regarding the nature of the retail data. Some of the  most relevant questions and the answers that could be answered from this project are:

- What is the overall sales performance of the retail chain over the last 5 years ?
  - The overall sales perfromance of the retail chain has be fluctuating through out the last 5 years

    | Year  | Sales     |
    |---    |---        |
    | 2010  | 43419     |
    | 2011  | 7075088   |
    | 2012  | 5842231   |
    | 2013  | 16344878  |
    | 2014  | 45642     |

- Which age group of customers generate the most revenue for the business ?
  - The customers with age 50 to 59 generate the most revenue for the business
      
    | Customer Age Group | Sales    |
    |---                 |---       |
    | 50 - 59            | 10578347 |
    | 40 - 49            | 8664719  |
    | 60 - 69	           | 6489920  |
    | 70 - 79	           | 2823237  |
    | 80 and Above	     | 795035   |

- Which category of products generate the most revenue for the company in percentage ?
  - The category 'Bikes' generate the most revenue for the company
    
    | Category    | Sales by Category | Total Sales | Percentage |
    |---          |---                |---          |---         |
    |Bikes        | 28311657          | 29351258	  | 96.46%     |
    | Accessories	| 699909	          | 29351258	  | 2.38%      |
    | Clothing	  | 339692	          | 29351258	  | 1.16%      |

    This could adversely affect the company as disruption in bike sales could reduced the revenue considerably
